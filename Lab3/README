Instructions:

1. GCC make statements to be executed in each c codes folder (cd to code folder)
2. To compile with test data: gcc -o main main.c data.h -lm
3. To compile with IRIS data: gcc -o main main.c data.h -lm -DIRIS_DATA=1
4. To compile with BME data: gcc -o main main.c data.h -lm -DBME_DATA=1

Python Scripts:

1. calculateKmeansAndSomWithSklearn.ipynb: we first used Sklearn to generate the Kmeans and SOM and then evaluated the results with plots and the RAND index.
2. calculateRandForKmeansFromC.ipynb: Takes results produced by c code for Kmeans as a text file and calculates RAND indexes.
3. calculateRandForSOMFromC.ipynb: Takes results procuded by c code for SOM as a text file and calculates RAND indexes.
4. dataToCHead.ipyb: Converts the dataset text files to an array that can be included in the c code as a data.h file
