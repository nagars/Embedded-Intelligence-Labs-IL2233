Instructions:

1. GCC make statements to be executed in each c codes folder (cd to code folders)
	- To compile with test data: gcc -o main main.c data.h -lm
	- To compile with IRIS data: gcc -o main main.c data.h -lm -DIRIS_DATA=1
	- To compile with BME data: gcc -o main main.c data.h -lm -DBME_DATA=1

2. data.h was generated by converting the dataset files through a python script found in Task1 folder

3. Test sets used to confirm the algorithms are working are included in the c code
